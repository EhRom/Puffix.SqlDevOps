# Deploy SSIS packages and configuration

The scripts in this folder are designed to deploy SSIS packages, and their environment to a SQL Server Integration Service instance. It can be associated with [Sql Agent Jobs deployment](../SqlAgentJobs/README.md) for full automation of the deployment.

## Script files

The following file tree is expected on the deployment machine in order to be able to run the scripts:

```text
| - <root>
|  | - Scripts
|  |  | - SsisPackageAndEnvironment.ps1
|  |  | - deploy-ssis.ps1
|  |  | - undeploy-ssis.ps1
|  |  | - DecryptOpsCredentials.ps1
|  |  | - DecryptOpsCredentials.ps1 (option)
|  |  | - UseOpsCredentials.ps1 (option)
|  | - <env 1>
|  |  | - settings-<env 1>.txt
|  |  | - ssisenvironment-<env 1>.json
|  |  | - credentials-<env 1>.enc (option)
|  | - <env 2>
|  |  | - settings-<env 2>.txt
|  |  | - ssisenvironment-<env 2>.json
|  |  | - credentials-<env 2>.enc (option)
```

## SsisPackageAndEnvironment.ps1

The `SsisPackageAndEnvironment.ps1` script is the core library and objects for deploying SSIS packages (`.ispac` files) and the SSIS environments linked to the packages.

## deploy-ssis.ps1

The `deploy-ssis.ps1` is used to deploy the SSIS packages and the SSIS environements. The SSIS environments contains the configuration of the SSIS packages, especially the secret to connect to the data sournces. The `deploy-ssis.ps1` script contains three sections:

1. Load the parameters from the `ssisenvironment-<env>.txt` file,
1. Load the secrets from the `credentials-<env>.enc` file (option),

  > Alternatives to the encrypted file will soon be available cf. [credentials-\<env\>.enc, DecryptOpsCredentials.ps1 & UseOpsCredentials.ps1](#credentials-envenc-decryptopscredentialsps1--useopscredentialsps1) paragraph.

1. Deploy the SSIS packages and environments using the `.ispac` file specified in the `ssisenvironment-<env>.txt` file, the `CredentialManager` object and the `ssisenvironment-<env>.json` for the difinition of the environments and the link to the SSIS packages.

As all the configuration to deploy the artefacts is specified in settings files dedicated to environments, the only command to execute is:

```powershell
.\deploy-ssis.ps1 '<env>'
```

With `<env>` as the name of the environment to deploy.

## undeploy-ssis.ps1

The `undeploy-ssis.ps1` is used to undeploy the SSIS packages and the SSIS environements. The script contains two sections:

1. Load the parameters from the `ssisenvironment-<env>.txt` file,
1. Undeploy the SSIS packages and environments using the `.ispac` file specified in the `ssisenvironment-<env>.txt` file and the `ssisenvironment-<env>.json` for the difinition of the environments and the link to the SSIS packages.

As all the configuration to deploy the artefacts is specified in settings files dedicated to environments, the only command to execute is:

```powershell
.\undeploy-ssis.ps1 '<env>'
```

With `<env>` as the name of the environment to deploy.

## settings-\<env\>.txt

The `settings-<env>.txt` contains the definition of the environment to deploy, with the two level of parameters:

1. The SSIS catalog parameters
1. The SSIS artefacts sections

It also contains the reference to the secrets container.

```text
[General]
Version=<Version number>
CredentialsPathPattern=..\{0}\credentials-{0}.enc

[SSIS]
SsisCatalogName=<Catalog SSIS name e.g. SSISDB>
SsisCatalogPassword=<SSIS Catalog Password or name to the credentials to use>
SsisPackageConfigurationPathPattern=..\{0}\ssisenvironment-{0}.json

[SSIS>ODS]
SsisOdsFolderName=<SSIS folder name for packages>
SsisOdsPackagePath=<Path to the ispac file>
SsisOdsProjectName=<ProjectName>
SsisOdsEnvironmentNames=<EnvironmentNames>
```

### Secrets container reference

The `CredentialsPathPattern` contains the reference to the encrypted secrets container. The file is generated with PowerShell scripts. See [credentials-\<env\>.enc, DecryptOpsCredentials.ps1 & UseOpsCredentials.ps1](#credentials-envenc-decryptopscredentialsps1--useopscredentialsps1) paragraph for more information.

  > Alternatives to the encrypted file will soon be available.

```text
[General]
Version=<Version number>
CredentialsPathPattern=..\{0}\credentials-{0}.enc
```

|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
|Version|Informative version number of the solution|
|CredentialsPathPattern|File path pattern for the encrypted secrets container file.|

### Catalog reference

The SSIS catalog is the central point for storing projects, packages, and packages parameters, eventually within environments. The `settings-<env>.txt` contains a reference to the SSIS catalog where to deploy the projects, the packages and the environments.

```text
[SSIS]
SsisCatalogName=<Catalog SSIS name e.g. SSISDB>
SsisCatalogPassword=<SSIS Catalog Password or name to the credentials to use>
SsisPackageConfigurationPathPattern=..\{0}\ssisenvironment-{0}.json
```

|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
|SsisCatalogName|Name of the SSIS catalog, usually *SSISDB*|
|SsisCatalogPassword|SSIS Catalog Password or name to the credentials to use, stored in the `credentials-\<env\>.enc` file[^1].|
|SsisPackageConfigurationPathPattern|File path pattern to get the sqljobs definition file.|

[^1]: The script first tries to get the value in the secret container if not null, otherwise, it uses the value as the password.

### Artefacts sections

A configuration file can contains one or more artefacts sections. An artefactact section is composed by:

|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
|Ssis<`section name e.g. ODS`>FolderName|Name of the folder where to store the artefacts|
|Ssis<`section name e.g. ODS`>PackagePath|File path of the package (`.isapc`) file|
|Ssis<`section name e.g. ODS`>ProjectName|Name of the project.|
|Ssis<`section name e.g. ODS`>EnvironmentNames|Name of the environment, or list of names (separated by a `\|` character) of environments.|

```text
[SSIS><section name e.g. ODS>]
Ssis<section name e.g. ODS>FolderName=<SSIS folder name for packages>
Ssis<section name e.g. ODS>PackagePath=<Path to the ispac file>
Ssis<section name e.g. ODS>ProjectName=<ProjectName>
Ssis<section name e.g. ODS>EnvironmentNames=<EnvironmentNames>
```

## credentials-\<env\>.enc, DecryptOpsCredentials.ps1 & UseOpsCredentials.ps1

The `credentials-<env>.enc` is an encryped file which contains encrypted credentials (two level of encryption).

The file is decrypted with the `DecryptOpsCredentials.ps1` script, and loaded in a `CredentialManager` object (cf. [OpsCredentials](../Secrets/OpsCredentials.md) for more information)

The `CredentialManager` object is used by the `SsisPackageAndEnvironment.ps1` script to define the secrets required by SSIS environments and packages. This is a solution for storing passwords securely (double encryption) in a Git repository, even though storing, even encrypted secrets, in a Git repository should be avoided.

The documentation to create and maintain the `credentials-<env>.enc` file is available in the [GenerateCredentialsAndSecret manual](../Secrets/GenerateCredentialsAndSecret.md).

> Alternatives with secret storage in an Azure Key Vault or an Azure DevOps library will soon be available.

## ssisenvironment-\<env\>.json

The `ssisenvironment-\<env\>.json` file contains the definition of the environments, i.e. the set of the package parameters that define the environment. The parameters are grouped in the `elements` collection, and are defined by the following properties:

|Property|Description|Type|Sample value|
|---|---|:---:|---|
|**name**|Name of the parameterstring|*ODSDbName*|
|**description**|Description on the parameter|string|*Name of the ODS database*|
|**value**|Value of the parameter, or reference to the secret if the value is encrypted. The value remains a string independenlty of the element type|string|<ul><li>`ODS`</li><li>`secretOdsDbName`</li></ul>|
|**isEncryptedValue**|Indicates whether the value is encrypted, and therefore is the name of the secret reference, or not|boolean|*true* or *false*|
|**elementType**|Type of the value|integer|<ul><li>`0`: String</li><li>`1`: Boolean</li><li>`2`: Byte</li><li>`3`: DateTime</li><li>`4`: Decimal</li><li>`5`: Double</li><li>`6`: Int16</li><li>`7`: Int32</li><li>`8`: Int64</li><li>`9`: SByte</li><li>`10`: Single</li><li>`11`: UInt32</li><li>`12`: UInt64</li></ul>|
|**isSensitive**|Indicates whether the value is sensitive, and therefore masked to the end user within the UI, or not.|boolean|*true* or *false*|
|**addToProject**|Indicates whether to create a link betwwen the environment variable and the project.|boolean|*true* or *false*|
|**packageList**|List of packages to which the variable is scoped. The package names are separated by a `,` character. An empty value means that the variable is not scoped to any particular packages.|string|
|**environmentName**|Name of the environment the variable belongs to.|string|<ul><li>`Dev`</li><li>`Test`</li><li>`Prod`</li><li>...</li></ul>|

Sample:

```json
{
    "elements": [
      {
        "name": "<Name of the parameter>",
        "description": "<Description on the parameter>",
        "value": "<Value of the parameter, or reference to the secret if the value is encrypted>",
        "elementType": 0,
        "addToProject": true,
        "packageList": "",
        "environmentName": "EnvironmentName"
      },
      {
        "name": "ParameterName",
        "description": "Paramter with encrypted value description",
        "value": "secretReference",
        "isEncryptedValue": true,
        "elementType": 0,
        "isSensitive": true,
        "addToProject": true,
        "packageList": "",
        "environmentName": "EnvironmentName"
      }
    ]
  }
```
